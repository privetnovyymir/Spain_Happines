# Spain_Happiness
Data analysis over happiness in Spain (125k observations CIS based dataset)

# Libraries that must be installed:
asciitable, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, category_encoders, from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, 
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier, 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, 
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, 
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# System Prerequisites required: 
Python 3.6.8 (min: 3.6)

# Conclusions:
Within the code as comments and printing the code while running

# Miscellaneous:
(1) Notebooks, Jupyter and or Markdown has not been used due little time due workloads (3:34am right now ...).
(2) The first code is the 'Cleansing and Preprocessing' which reads the .txt file (which should be changed for the reader) and at the end, the code creates 2 files in the same folder (which should be changed for the reader) as inputs for the 'EDA' code.
(3) The third code, the Ensemble Learning Model, reads only from the same 2 output files from the 'Cleansing and Preprocessing' code, and nothing from the 'EDA' code.
